BitShares Core Development Worker Proposal (1.14.66)
====================================================

Author: Abit

Background
----------

I've been contributing to BitShares development for a long time, mostly worked on
the back-end (bitshares-core repository). Now I feel it's important for BitShares
to show to outside that I'm hired and will be continuously contributing but not a
random contributor.


Worker
------

I've created an account `abit-worker` (ID `"1.2.459901"`). The account will be
changed to trusted community escrow multi-sig (3/4) schema with these members (subject to change so far):

- `abit` (me)
- `xeroc`
- `bitcrab`
- `bhuz`

I've created a worker `"Abit - Core Developer - 201712~201803"` (ID `"1.14.66"`).

The worker will mainly focus on the bitshares-core repository, tasks include:

* code review
* bug fix
* new feature development
* documentation
* mentoring
* coordination


Duration and Pay
----------------

This proposal will last for 4 months, start from 1st December 2017.

One-time cost reimbursement:
* Worker account lifetime fee: `1456.76103 * 20% = 291.35220 BTS`
* Worker creation fee: `606.98376 * 20% = 121.39675 BTS`

Monthly pay:
* $2,000 per month, as 20 hours per month * $100 per hour

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by @xeroc
([link](https://github.com/xeroc/worker-proposals/blob/master/2017-02.md#worker)):

* 12.36 BTS/bitUSD = settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writting (2017-11-12)
* 2.5 = multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow at 2.5x collateral if needed
* 2000 usd/month * 12.36 bts/usd * 2.5 = 61800 BTS/month
* 61800 / 30 = 2060 BTS/day

Note: I will be receiving 2000 bitUSD per month, but not really 2060 BTS per day.
The multi-sig scheme in worker account `abit-worker` will only send the correct exact
amount of funds to me. Rest of BTS will be burned back to the chain at a proper time.
